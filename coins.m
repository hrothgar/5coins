% Hrothgar, May 2013
%
% Runs a simulation of the "Five Coins" problem described at
%       http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/invitation.pdf,
% periodically printing results to the terminal.
%
% The results of the Monte Carlo trials are collected in `coincounts`,
% a 3-vector corresponding to the frequency of 3, 4, and 5 coins being
% placed during the trials. I.e. `coincounts` = [#3s #4s #5s].
%
% This code doesn't actually compute where all the coins go --
% it doesn't have to. It only computes how many coins there are.
%
% On my MacBook Pro I compute around 5200 trials/sec.
