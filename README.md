An improved estimate for the "5 Coins" problem of L.N. Trefethen described at [http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/invitation.pdf]. Any comments, corrections, and suggestions are gladly welcomed. Email me at hrothgarrrr@gmail.com.

The script `coins.m`, after running for a little over 22 hours, reported these results:

    Just hit trial #423000000.

     # coins        n            %

        4      327555681    77.4363312
        5       22489495     5.3166655
    -----------------------------------
    Elapsed time is 79757.280840 seconds.

A 95% confidence interval for the true value *X* of the probability that a trial admits five coins looks something like

    0.053166655 ± 2 √(0.053166655×(1-0.053166655)/423000000),

which works out to the range [0.0531884, 0.0531448]. So we can with confidence amend the estimate to the solution of the five coins problem: **X ≈ 0.0531**. Anyone will to run this thing for a few days can happily grab another digit.

1.  **coins.m**

    The main routine. Keeps track of progress in the 3-vector `coincoints`. By default it prints out running results every 100,000 trials (which is every 30–45 seconds on my Mac).
2.  **coins_history.m**

    The same as the main routine, but it runs a little slower since it collects information with a slightly finer granularity. Instead of simply binning the 3s, 4s, and 5s, it builds a vector `cointrials` in which each element is in {3,4,5} and corresponds to a single trial. Also prints verbose output each 100,000 trials.
3.  **coins_plot.m**

    To illustrate the problem in *stunning 2-D*, this script pauses between trials to display graphically the result of the last throw. Hit enter at the terminal to reiterate.
